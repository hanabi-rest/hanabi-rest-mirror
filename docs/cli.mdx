By using the CLI (Command Line Interface), you can dump APIs generated by Hanabi.rest locally. This is ideal for actually running the generated code. Dependencies are also automatically installed.

The source for the CLI is available on GitHub. Feel free to join the development freely!

## Dumping API files

Running the following command in the directory you want to create will dump API code and SQL, and also install Wrangler and Cloudflare types to make it easier to start your project.

Additionally, any additional dependencies will be automatically detected and installed using your package manager.

```bash
$ npx @hanabi/cli <version-id>
```

If the API code depends on a database, a migration is necessary. Please modify the `wrangler.toml` file appropriately and then run the following command.

```bash
$ cd <app-dir>

## local migration
$ npm run migrate

## prod migration
$ npm run migrate:prod
```

To start and deploy a project with Wrangler, enter the following command.

```bash
## local development
$ npm run dev

## deploy to cloudflare workers
$ npm run deploy
```
